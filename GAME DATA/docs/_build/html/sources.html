                    <p>For my game, I utilized pixel art assets from Green Pixels as enemy characters. I chose to use these assets because I am not a graphic designer, and they fit the aesthetic and theme of my game perfectly. This allowed me to focus more on the programming and gameplay mechanics aspects of the project.</p>
